# Geometry Calculator

## Overview
This is a Python program that serves as a geometry calculator. It allows users to compute the **area**, **perimeter**, and **circumference** for different geometric shapes, including triangles, rectangles, and circles. The program is interactive, user-friendly, and modular, with functions designed for specific calculations.

## Features
- **Triangle**:
  - Calculate area using base and height.
  - Calculate perimeter using the lengths of three sides.
- **Rectangle**:
  - Compute area and perimeter using length and width.
- **Circle**:
  - Find area and circumference using radius.
- **Interactive Menu**:
  - A continuous loop allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
  - Option to exit when done.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of how to run Python scripts.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python assgn3.py

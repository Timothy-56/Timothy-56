# Geometry Calculator

## Description
This Python program is a simple geometry calculator that allows users to compute areas and perimeters (or circumferences) for different shapes interactively. The program includes calculations for triangles, rectangles, and circles, and provides a user-friendly menu for seamless interaction.

## Features
1. **Triangle**:
   - Calculate the area using base and height.
   - Compute the perimeter using the lengths of three sides.
2. **Rectangle**:
   - Calculate the area and perimeter using length and width.
3. **Circle**:
   - Compute the area and circumference using radius.
4. **Interactive Menu**:
   - A looped menu for multiple calculations.
   - Option to exit when finished.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Program**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Save the script as `geometry_calculator.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the script:
     ```bash
     python geometry_calculator.py
     ```
2. **Choose an Option**:
   - The program will display a menu.
   - Enter the corresponding number (1â€“5) based on the desired calculation:
     - Option 1: Area of a Triangle.
     - Option 2: Perimeter of a Triangle.
     - Option 3: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle.
     - Option 4: Area and Circumference of a Circle.
     - Option 5: Exit the program.

3. **Input Required Values**:
   - Follow the prompts to input dimensions such as base, height, length, width, radius, or side lengths.

4. **View Results**:
   - The program will display the calculated result (e.g., area, perimeter, or circumference).
   - You can continue with additional calculations or exit the program.

## Example Usage
### Menu Example:
```plaintext
Choose the shape:
1. Triangle (Area using base and height)
2. Triangle (Perimeter using three sides)
3. Rectangle (Area and Perimeter)
4. Circle (Area and Circumference)
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 1
Enter the base of the triangle: 10
Enter the height of the triangle: 5
Area of the triangle: 25.0
